This is a work in progress.

This is a static site generator I wrote that specifically handles multiple sites from one directory and can also handle comics.

Templates first look for local specific templates and then look in the shared pool of templates.
The same goes for CSS (which is in Stylus) and JavaScript (which is in CoffeeScript).

Everything is minified and concatenated to the smallest possible files.

This manual will be expanded in the future.
